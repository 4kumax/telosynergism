      {
        "title": "6. Why does a person need telos?",
        "body": "Without telos a person sinks into chaos, loses energy, walks in circles, becomes dependent on external forces, and is easy to manipulate. With telos, a person holds direction, keeps focus, grows rather than drifts, creates value, and lives consciously."
