        "body": "Telosynergism is a direction-centered ideology of meaning. It teaches you to live so that your actions amplify your telos—your inner meaning vector—and resonate with people, technology, and nature. The world is stronger when its parts move in the same meaning direction."
      },
      {
        "title": "2. What is telos?",
        "body": "Telos is your highest purpose—your meaning vector. Not a wish, not a dream, not a mood, but a direction you are meant to grow into. Telos exists for a person, a family, a city, a country, and humanity."

      {
        "title": "4. What is the core idea?",

        "title": "5. How is it different from socialism and capitalism?",
        "body": "Socialism: the goal is equality, the center is public ownership. Capitalism: the goal is profit, the center is private ownership. Telosynergism: the goal is amplification of the meaning vector, the center is meaning as a public good."
      },
      {
        "title": "6. Why does a person need telos?",
        "body": "Without telos a person sinks into chaos, loses energy, walks in circles, becomes dependent on external forces, and is easy to manipulate. With telos, a person holds direction, keeps focus, grows rather than drifts, creates value, and lives consciously."
      },
      {
        "title": "7. How do you find your telos?",

      },

        "title": "12. What does Telosynergism require from the state?",

      },
      {
        "title": "13. What does it require from technology?",

        "title": "14. What is the Telos-Synergy Index (IT)?",

        "title": "15. What does Telosynergism require from the individual?",
